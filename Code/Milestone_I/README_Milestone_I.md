# Description of file milestone I

This file contains the simpel model used in milestone I.
The model only has one layer. The images were resized to 128 * 128 and later to 64 * 64 when it was noted 
that this change in size made the code work faster without losing a lot of data.
The data was splitted in 80% trainingsset and a 20% testset.
